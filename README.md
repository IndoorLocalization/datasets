## datasets
1. This dataset was collected at SAS 2016 in Catania, Italy.  As noted in the files, they contain accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data.   
2. They were collected by the conference partipants using multiple devices, supervised by Yanyan Zhuang, Seth Miller and Richard Weiss.

3. The units of measurement are:

ax, ay, az - m/s/s

gx, gy, gz - rad/s

mx, my, mz - uT (micro-Tesla)

4. The height of each user is included with the sensor data for that user.
Since data was received asynchronously for each sensor, each line will typically only contain data for one sensor, so the others will be blank.

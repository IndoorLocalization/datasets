The deadline for the indoor localization challeng is Sept 15, 2016.  
The goal is to use the sensor measurements to estimate the x, y-coordinates of the fiducial points as accurately as possible.
For the first fiducial point, the phone was held in a vertical position, so the y-axis was pointing up, and the z-axis was aligned with the direction that the user was facing.

The winners will receive a free Android device.  Winners will be announced in early October.  In order to enter, you will need to submit a description of your algorithm and the estimates it produced for the x,y coordinates of the fiducial points in the dataset.

The deadline for the indoor localization challeng is Sept 15, 2016.  
The goal is to use the sensor measurements to estimate the x, y-coordinates of the fiducial points as accurately as possible.
For the first fiducial point, the phone was held in a vertical position, so the y-axis was pointing up, and the z-axis was aligned with the direction that the user was facing.

The winners will receive a free Android device.  Winners will be announced in early October.  In order to enter, you will need to submit a description of your algorithm and the estimates it produced for the x,y coordinates of the fiducial points in the world coordinate system.  The first fiducial point is located at (0,0).  The x-axis of the world coordinate system is horizontal and aligned with the z-axis of the phone.  The y-axis is horizontal and points to the right of the phone.
